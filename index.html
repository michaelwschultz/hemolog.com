    <h1>Hemolog</h1>
    <h4>
      Hemolog was the first iPhone app available for hemophiliacs back in 2011.
      It has sense been removed from the app store.

    <p>
      I initially designed Hemolog for myself. I was in college at the time and
      had been building websites and web apps for friends and family along with
      the odd job here and there.

      Tell more of my story here...

      Hemolog ment the world to me and I'm glad it was able to serve people well
      for the 4? TK years it was on the app store.
