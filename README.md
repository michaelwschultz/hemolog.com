## History
Hemolog was the first iPhone app available for hemophiliacs back in 2011. It has since been removed from the App Store.
I initially designed Hemolog for myself. I was in college at the time and had been building websites and web apps for friends and family, along with the odd job here and there.

Hemolog ment the world to me and I'm glad it was able to serve people well for the 4 years it was on the App Store. But this year (2020), I decided to take another crack at it. The first version never really lived up to what it was suppose to be. The most important part of having data in a digital format is the ability to quickly gain insights from it. The first version didn't have any built in analytics or stats. This time around, I'm made that the number one priority.

I hope you find Hemolog useful and friendly to use. Or, if you don't have hemophilia, perhaps just a project that's interesting to you in some way.
